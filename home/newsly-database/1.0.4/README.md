# Newsly

[Newsly](https://github.com/martinikolaev/newsly) is a news scrapper. It collects all titles from configured tabloids and creates links. All titles in one place without additional bullshit!

> This is required in order to apply the correct permissions to the `Newsly` directories.
> Afterward, the `Newsly` container will run as a **non**-root user (Default: `568`).
> All mounted storage(s) will be `chown`ed only if the parent directory does not match the configured user.
