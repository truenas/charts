# Override this with the plex claim token from plex.tv/claim
claimToken: ""

# Set the timezone of the plex server
timezone: "Etc/UTC"

# add your pod network subnet to the `List of IP addresses and networks that are allowed without auth`
# This will override the manual settings, so only use this if you will not need to change it manually.
# This list will be automatically converted to a command seperated string when passed to the container.
# You would specify this when using helm CLI with --set allowedNetworks="{127.0.0.1,10.54.2.0/24}"
# allowedNetworks:
#   -   127.0.0.1
#   -   10.54.2.0/24

# Default is true, you would only need to set this if you want to disable it.
# changeConfigDirOwnership: true

# advertiseIp This variable defines the additional IPs on which the server may be be found.
# For example: http://10.1.1.23:32400.
# This adds to the list where the server advertises that it can be found.
# See https://hub.docker.com/r/plexinc/pms-docker/ for details
