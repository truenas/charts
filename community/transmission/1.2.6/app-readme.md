# Transmission

[Transmission](https://transmissionbt.com/) is designed for easy, powerful use.

> When application is installed, a container will be launched with **root** privileges.
> This is required in order to apply the correct permissions to the Transmission directories.
> Afterward, the `Transmission` container will run as a **non**-root user (Default: `568`).

For additional configuration via environment variables, see [Container's source env var list](https://github.com/onedr0p/containers/tree/main/apps/transmission).
