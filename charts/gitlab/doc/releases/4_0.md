# GitLab Cloud Native Chart 4.0

Along with the `13.0` release of GitLab, we have bumped the chart version to `4.0`.

## Summary of major changes

- The bundled PostgreSQL database is [upgraded to 11.7](#postgresql)
- Replaced Unicorn chart with [Webservice chart](#webservice-chart)
- Default webserver switched from Unicorn to [Puma](#puma-webserver)

## Problematic Helm 2.15

Helm v2.15.x [has a severe bug](https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/6767), and absolutely should not be used.

If you are to use Helm 2, use `2.14.3` or `>= 2.16.1`.

## Upgrade path from 3.x

In order to upgrade to the `4.0` version of the chart, you first need to upgrade to the latest `3.3.x`
release of the chart. Check the [version mapping details](../installation/version_mappings.md) for the latest patch.

If you don't first upgrade to the latest `3.3.x` patch, you will see the following error from `helm upgrade`

```shell
Error: UPGRADE FAILED: Job failed: BackoffLimitExceeded
```

You can then confirm you are in this situation by looking for pods in error with the text `gitlab-upgrade-check` in the name.

If you check the logs for those pods will see the version upgrade error message:

```plaintext
It seems you are upgrading the GitLab Helm Chart from X (GitLab X) to 4.0.0 (GitLab 13.0.0).
It is required to upgrade to the latest 3.3.x version first before proceeding.
Please follow the upgrade documentation at https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/releases/3_0.html
and upgrade to GitLab Helm Chart version 3.3.x before upgrading to 4.0.0.
```

## Upgrade from 3.3.x

Please follow the [upgrade steps for 4.0 release](../installation/upgrade.md).

## Major Changes

### PostgreSQL

As part of the `4.0.0` release of this chart, we upgraded the bundled [PostgreSQL chart](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/postgresql)
from `7.7.3` to `8.9.4`. This updates the PostgreSQL version from `10.9` to `11.7`. This is not a drop in replacement. Manual
steps need to be performed to upgrade the database.

The [4.0 upgrade steps](../installation/upgrade.md#upgrade-steps-for-40-release)
includes the manual steps required during upgrade.

NOTE:
Note that PostgreSQL 11 is the minimum required PostgreSQL version in GitLab 13.0 (May 2020).
PostgreSQL 9.6 and PostgreSQL 10 are no longer supported by GitLab 13.0 and later.

### Webservice chart

The Unicorn subchart has been renamed to Webservice. When upgrading, Helm will remove all the Kubernetes resources
for Unicorn and create new ones under the Webservice name. The chart was renamed to reflect the fact that both
Unicorn and Puma are supported webservers by this chart. More details can be found in the
[Merge Request introducing the change.](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/gitlab/-/merge_requests/1145)

NOTE:
GitLab will be unreachable during the upgrade until the new pods are ready.

### Puma webserver

The default webserver used in the Webservice chart has been set to Puma. This brings several
[performance improvements](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/operations/puma.html#why-switch-to-puma) and
unblocks work on features like the [dependency proxy](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/gitlab/-/issues/1284).

The Unicorn webserver will remain supported for now, and can be configured using:

```yaml
gitlab:
  webservice:
    webServer: unicorn
```

For more details see the [webServer options](../charts/gitlab/webservice/index.md#webserver-options).

## Upgrade path from 2.x

You first need to upgrade to the `3.3.x` release of the charts, before upgrading to `4.0`. Please follow the
[3.0 upgrade documentation](3_0.md).

## Upgrade path from 1.x

You first need to upgrade to the `2.6.x` release of the charts, then to `3.3.x` before upgrading to `3.0`. Please follow
the [2.0 upgrade documentation](2_0.md).

## Known issues and limitations

Helm Chart Issues/Limitations:

- No GitLab Pages support: <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/gitlab/-/issues/37>

Features that are currently out of scope:

- Relative URL as the GitLab Endpoint: <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/gitlab/-/issues/406>

## Release cadence

We will be releasing a new version of the chart with each new GitLab patch.

More information on how we are versioning the chart can be found in the [release documentation](../development/release.md).

Along with the issues and merge requests in this repository, a [changelog](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/gitlab/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) is available to more easily follow along with updates.

## Kubernetes deployment support

GitLab is tested against:

- [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/)
- [Amazon EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/)

Other Kubernetes deployments should also work. In the event of a specific non-GKE deployment issue, please raise an issue.

This release has automated CI testing for Kubernetes version `v1.14.10-gke.17` and `v1.13.12-eks-879c36`.
