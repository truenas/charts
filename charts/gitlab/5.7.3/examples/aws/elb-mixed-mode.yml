# Configure the use of AWS ELB LoadBalancer, using layers 4 (TCP) and 7 (HTTPS)
#
# HTTPS (443) -> ELB termination -> NGINX (re-encrypt w/ self-signed) -> HTTPS (443)
# TCP (22) -> ELB -> NGINX -> TCP (22)
# 
# - Configures ELB to be layer 7, terminating TLS with ACM
# - Configures ELB to re-encrypt to HTTPS backend with self-signed certificates after termination
# - Non HTTPS specified ports are default as TCP backend 
# - Configures NGINX to trust X-Forwarded-* headers from ELB
