# openshift/gitlab-shell-multiple-external-ip.yaml

# This example shows how to assign multiple external IPs to GitLab Shell. This is required for
# deployment on OpenShift.
#
# You may have to define an external DNS record for these IPs. If you did, you also need to pass
# the external domain name.
#
# For more information see:
