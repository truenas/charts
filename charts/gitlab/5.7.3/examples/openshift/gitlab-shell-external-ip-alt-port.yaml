# openshift/gitlab-shell-external-ip-alt-port.yaml

# This example shows how to assign an external IP to GitLab Shell with an alternate port. This
# is required for deployment on OpenShift, when the default SSH port is not available and you
# want to use an alternate port.
#
# You may have to define an external DNS record for this IP. If you did, you also need to pass
# the external domain name.
#
# For more information see:
