# This is an example values.yaml. It adjusts various default settings in order to fit GitLab
# into the standard GKE cluster defaults. (3 n1-standard-1 nodes). The is **not recommended** for a
# production deploy of GitLab.
#
# - all pods start with a single replica, rather than their other highly available defaults
# - resource requests are tuned down to the minimal requirements for a single user to fully use GitLab
# - prometheus, gitlab ci runner, and the gitlab toolbox (used for backups and maintenance) are disabled
