[IPFS](https://ipfs.io) is a global, versioned, peer-to-peer filesystem. It combines good ideas from previous systems such Git, BitTorrent, Kademlia, SFS, and the Web. It is like a single bittorrent swarm, exchanging git objects. IPFS provides an interface as simple as the HTTP web, but with permanence built in. You can also mount the world at /ipfs.
