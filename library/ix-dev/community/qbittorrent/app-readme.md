# qBittorrent

The [qBittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/) project aims to provide an open-source software alternative to ÂµTorrent.

> On every application start, a container will be launched with **root** privileges. This is required
> in order to apply the correct permissions to the qBittorrent directories. Afterward, the `qBittorrent` container
> will run as a **non**-root user (Default: `568`).
