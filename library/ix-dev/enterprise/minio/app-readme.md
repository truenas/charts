It is API compatible with Amazon S3 cloud storage service. Use MinIO to build high performance infrastructure
for machine learning, analytics and application data workloads.

> During the installation process, a container will be launched with **root** privileges. This is required
> in order to apply the correct permissions to the MinIO data directory. Afterward, the `MinIO` container
> will run as a **non**-root user (`568`).
> Same applies to the `postgres` container. This will run afterwards as a **non**-root user (`999`).
> On each upgrade, a container will be launched with **root** privileges in order to apply the correct
> permissions to the `postgres` backups directory. Container that performs the backup will run as a **non**-root user (`999`) afterwards.
> Keep in mind the permissions on the backup directory will be changed to `999:999` on **every** update.
> But will only be changed once for the `MinIO` and `postgres` data directories.
