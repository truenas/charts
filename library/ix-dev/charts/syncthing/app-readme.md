# Syncthing

[Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/) is a continuous file synchronization program. It synchronizes files between two or
more computers in real time, safely protected from prying eyes. Your data is your data alone and you deserve to choose
where it is stored, whether it is shared with some third party, and how it's transmitted over the internet.

> **WARNING** Do check out [official docs](https://docs.syncthing.net/users/faq.html#what-things-are-synced) to see what is synced.
